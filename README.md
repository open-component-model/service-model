# Service Model for Cloud Environments

This project describes a proposal for a service model for cloud-based services.
It is based on separate descriptions stored together with other development artifacts in
[OCM](https://ocm.software) component versions. The identities of the model elements
are linked to the identities of the hosting component versions.

The specification is found in [docs/ServiceModel.docx](docs/ServiceModel.docx).
Additionally, the project contains a library to retrieve such artifacts and combine them to
a close descriptions. This library is used by an OCM command plugin, which can be used to
explore the elements of the model according to their identities (which include the OCM
component version identities usable to retrieve the description fragments).
